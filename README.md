This is an active project for backtesting various trading strategies, primarily based on technical indicators.
Backtesting_New is the latest executable version of the package, built on the Backtesting library for Python. 
Indicators used: candle-stick pattern, moving average lines, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastics, and more. 
The strategies are meant to be executed either on a standalone basis in the signals folder, or on a weighted basis.
